About the project

This project will include:
-- SMART method of formulating questions before analysis
-- based on the questions, SWO (Scope-Of-Wor) was made (according to the Google methodology for analysts)
-- elementary analysis in a Google Sheets, without using pivot tables, complex formulas and functions
-- heat map and visual perception of relationships and testing of hypotheses on transformed data.

About Dataset
This comprehensive dataset provides valuable insights into the growth patterns of various plants under different environmental conditions. 
Collected over time, it offers a detailed view of how factors such as temperature, humidity, pH level, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) affect the growth stages and development of these plants.

Plant_ID: Identifier for each plant.
Date: The date of the observation.
Temperature (°C): The temperature in degrees Celsius.
Humidity (%): The humidity level in percentage.
TDS Value (ppm): The Total Dissolved Solids value in parts per million.
pH Level: The pH level of the environment.
Growth Days: The number of days since the plant started growing until fully grown.
*******************************************************

SMART method

Analyze the dataset’s column names, values, and summary statistics (mean, median, quartiles, and min/max values), as well as contemplate goals to formulate SMART questions. 
SMART questions for the Lettuce Growth Days data could include:

Specific: Is there a connection between humidity and temperature? 

Measurable: How much growth is normal or expected over a one-week period?

Action-oriented: If total dissolved solids are increased when growing lettuce, will it shorten the time needed for the plants to reach maturity?

Relevant: Based on the dataset, how can predictions about growth be made given the conditions?

Time-bound: What is the date range for this dataset? Do we need an understanding of this data for next season?

SOW  (Scope-Of-Work)


Based on the SMART questions, create an SOW that outlines the analytics tasks.  


Purpose: 
Determine the most optimal temperature, humidity and fertilizer settings for short-term lettuce growing. The result will be recommendations for top 3 combinations

Scope / Major Project Activities:
What are the major parts of this project? List out the high-level steps, activities, or stages of the project, and give a brief description for each. 
Activity
Description
Database transformation.
bringing columns to the appropriate formats. Date formatting. 
Database analysis.
build a pivot table if necessary. establishing relationships


report preparation
conclusions, findings and recommendations


This project does not include:
Specify the things that this project isn’t responsible for doing (out of scope). 
growth analysis of another type of greenery
comparison analysis of lettuce growth with the previous period
Deliverables:
A specific list of things that your project will deliver.   

Deliverable
Description/ Details
Top 3
top 3 groups of three indicators (temperature, humidity, fertilizers) for a periodic growth period
recommendations 
recommendations for maintaining a balance of temperature and watering



Schedule Overview / Major Milestones:
The expected schedule for the project. This can be defined by milestones (e.g. “all data is cleaned and processed”), periods of time (“Week 1 / Week 2”), or other ways based on the needs of the project.
